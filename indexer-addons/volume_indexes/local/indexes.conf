# VOLUME SETTINGS
# In this example, the volume spec here is set to the indexer-specific
# path for data storage. It satisfies the "volume:primary" tag used in
# the indexes.conf which is shared between SH and indexers. 
# See also: org_all_indexes

# One Volume for Hot
[volume:hwprimary]
path = /opt/splunk-hotdata/indexes/
# Note: The *only* reason to use a volume is to set a cumulative size-based
# limit across several indexes stored on the same partition. There are *not*
# time-based volume limits.
# ~2.3 TB
maxVolumeDataSizeMB = 350000

# One volume for Cold
[volume:coldprimary]
path = /opt/splunk-colddata
# ~2.3 TB
maxVolumeDataSizeMB = 350000 


[volume:_splunk_summaries]
path = /opt/splunk-hotdata/summaries/
